-- write a detailed note on package .json
    package.json is the heart of a Node.js project.
    It is a metadata file that:
        Describes your project
        Manages dependencies (libraries)
        Defines scripts (commands)
        Stores configuration info
    📌 Without package.json, npm cannot manage your project properly.
